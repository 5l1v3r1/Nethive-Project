# Matching Algorithm. 
# Before searching for scripts in the
# HTTP request, the filter transforms the URL request (and
# any POST data) as follows:
# 1. URL decode (e.g., replace %41 with A). This step mimics the URL decoding that the server does when receiving an HTTP request (e.g., before PHP returns
# the value of $_GET["q"]).
# 2. Character set decode (e.g., replace UTF-7 code points
# with Unicode characters). This step mimics a transformation done by the HTML tokenizer.
# 3. HTML entity decode (e.g., replace &amp; with &). The
# filter applies this transformation only to some of the
# interception points. For example, inline scripts are not
# entity decoded but inline event handlers are.
